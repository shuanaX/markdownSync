## Meaningful Place

My meaningful place is my greatgrandmother’s house. 
My greatgrandma had eight children, five daughters and three sons, and they all had children, so my family is large. Every lunar new year eve, the family gathered for dinner. That is a traditional Chinese house. In order to enter, you must step over a high threshold, which has been crossed by four generations of the family. There are blackandwhite photos of my greatgrandfather and his youngest son, who died young, on the wall directly in front of the main door. One of my aunts' naught carving marks can still be seen on the table under the wall. My greatgrandmother slipped the red envelopes into my pocket in front of the old Chinese canopy bed. The dim light illuminated by a few tungsten lamps, the camphor and mold oozing from damp corners, and the local dialect surrounded me for the duration of my stay.
In a way, I believe this old house represents the roots of this family, now a large one. Likewise, the historic district it sits in reveals the roots of the city, now a large one.
Over time, things changed. Fewer relatives met. The eldest son of my greatgrandparents settled in a neighboring city and never returned. Sisters of my grandma clashed for various reasons and could never really make up. Fluorescent lamps replaced the tungsten lamps. My greatgrandmother passed away. The dialect was never something I learned fluently.
By the time I left to study abroad, the house had been inherited by the only male member of my mother's generation. However, he was no better than his cousins.
Perhaps the place you came from only exists when you leave. I left in stride.

## Recipe + Playlist 

Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine in Canada during the pandemic. Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine when I entered Canada during the epidemic. The recipe below comes from the afternoon when I was shocked by the expensive takeout costs in Canada and made up my mind to cook my own food. I made a video call to my mom who was eating breakfast, separated by a 15hour time difference, to ask her how to make chicken curry. Her remote instructions are recorded below.

------

Ingredients:

- 1 purple onion,  preferably a large one
- 1 carrot, with the head leaves cut off
- 1-2 potato, peeled
- 6 chicken thighs. If available, use skinless and boneless thighs, that will save you a LOT of work
- 2 Curry cubes, the soul of this dish

- Cooking oil, preferably olive oil, but that day I used grapeseed oil
- Enough water

------

1. De-bone the chicken thighs, which is not an easy task, and cut with the grain of the chicken. Watch how you hold the knife. My mom yelled at me across the phone to change my knife grip.
1. Cut the chicken thighs into pieces and set aside. Parallel to the direction of the bone, cut two slashes on each side.
1. Dice carrots, potatoes and onions.
3. Here comes the vegetables. Dice the carrot, the potato, the onion to pieces.
4. Boil the potatoes for a while to soften them, then sauté them with the carrots and onions in turn.
5. Add the chicken pieces to the pan with all the vegetables and sauté until the flesh turns white.
5. Add water to just submerge the ingredients. Boil over medium heat.
8. Once the water comes to a boil, add the curry and cook both pieces, stirring while simmering, until the chicken is tender. Stirring will prevent the curry and vegetables on the bottom from being overcooked. This is a long step, so some soothing but rhythmic music will help. I've attached my list of cooking songs at the end of the recipe, so stir to the music!
9. Serve it in a soup bowl or over rice. When I took the pot off the heat, my mom had to leave to go to work. She finished her breakfast and left her table, while I sat at my table to taste the first bite of my cooked dish. Our respective lives went on.

Here is the promised playlist. Enjoy these catchy songs and delicious curries!

## Scholarly Writing Experiment #1: Reading the Faculty

Dear Dr. Sowlati,

As a fourth-year student in the Woodworking program at the University of British Columbia, I am writing to seek the opportunity to have you as my future graduate supervisor from September, 2024. I studied WOOD 339 under your guidance and am now studying WOOD 440 and W00D 492, which made me realize how mathematical methods and optimization theory can be integrated with the forest industry and supply chain management. Upon visiting the website of your research group, I learned more about your work and your emphasis on applications of modeling and data analysis in industry engineering. I was impressed by one of your papers investigated a robust optimization model for a forest-based biomass supply chain by introducing uncertain variables, namely biomass availability and time interval.

I used to study optimal control based on fractional-order differential equations to analyze the uncertain dynamics of complex systems and optimize the desired properties. Although I have studied different application areas, such as option pricing and circuit systems reliability (I would love to show you my paper on this if you are interested in), I have not been able to apply what I have learned from my major, wood science, to  optimization and uncertainty researches. However, your group's work has inspired me to look at the potential applications of mathematical models in forestry. The review part of your paper motioned above, written in an simple and concise way, is especially helpful for me to seek an entry point for my future researches. 

I find that few papers in this area build explicit stochastic mathematical models to deal with real-world uncertainty. Most of the time the Monte Carlo method is used, which is also the case in some papers of your group. Fractional order equations and stochastic processes are powerful tools for describing real-world uncertainty and solving optimization problems, and they may find their application in the forestry field.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate my interest and to discuss in detail with you at your convenience. After completing my undergraduate studies, I intend to pursue a master's degree in the hybrid field of optimal control and forest industry management.. Your guidance would be invaluable to me. Hopefully I will be able to participate in research with your group. 

I am looking forward to you reply. 

Sincerely, 
Hongxuan Xia
