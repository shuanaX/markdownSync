My meaningful place is my great-grandmother’s house. 
My great-grandma had eight children, five daughters and three sons, and they all had children, so my family is large. Every lunar new year eve, the family gathered for dinner. That is a traditional Chinese house. In order to enter, you must step over a high threshold, which has been crossed by four generations of the family. There are black-and-white photos of my great-grandfather and his youngest son, who died young, on the wall directly in front of the main door. One of my aunts' naught carving marks can still be seen on the table under the wall. My great-grandmother slipped the red envelopes into my pocket in front of the old Chinese canopy bed. The dim light illuminated by a few tungsten lamps, the camphor and mold oozing from damp corners, and the local dialect surrounded me for the duration of my stay.
In a way, I believe this old house represents the roots of this family, now a large one. Likewise, the historic district it sits in reveals the roots of the city, now a large one.
Over time, things changed. Fewer relatives met. The eldest son of my great-grandparents settled in a neighboring city and never returned. Sisters of my grandma clashed for various reasons and could never really make up. Fluorescent lamps replaced the tungsten lamps. My great-grandmother passed away. The dialect was never something I learned fluently.
By the time I left to study abroad, the house had been inherited by the only male member of my mother's generation. However, he was no better than his cousins.
Perhaps the place you came from only exists when you leave. I left in stride.
