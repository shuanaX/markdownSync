## Meaningful Place

My meaningful place is my greatgrandmother’s house. 
My greatgrandma had eight children, five daughters and three sons, and they all had children, so my family is large. Every lunar new year eve, the family gathered for dinner. That is a traditional Chinese house. In order to enter, you must step over a high threshold, which has been crossed by four generations of the family. There are blackandwhite photos of my greatgrandfather and his youngest son, who died young, on the wall directly in front of the main door. One of my aunts' naught carving marks can still be seen on the table under the wall. My greatgrandmother slipped the red envelopes into my pocket in front of the old Chinese canopy bed. The dim light illuminated by a few tungsten lamps, the camphor and mold oozing from damp corners, and the local dialect surrounded me for the duration of my stay.
In a way, I believe this old house represents the roots of this family, now a large one. Likewise, the historic district it sits in reveals the roots of the city, now a large one.
Over time, things changed. Fewer relatives met. The eldest son of my greatgrandparents settled in a neighboring city and never returned. Sisters of my grandma clashed for various reasons and could never really make up. Fluorescent lamps replaced the tungsten lamps. My greatgrandmother passed away. The dialect was never something I learned fluently.
By the time I left to study abroad, the house had been inherited by the only male member of my mother's generation. However, he was no better than his cousins.
Perhaps the place you came from only exists when you leave. I left in stride.

## Recipe + Playlist 

Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine in Canada during the pandemic. Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine when I entered Canada during the epidemic. The recipe below comes from the afternoon when I was shocked by the expensive takeout costs in Canada and made up my mind to cook my own food. I made a video call to my mom who was eating breakfast, separated by a 15hour time difference, to ask her how to make chicken curry. Her remote instructions are recorded below.

------

Ingredients:

- 1 purple onion,  preferably a large one
- 1 carrot, with the head leaves cut off
- 1-2 potato, peeled
- 6 chicken thighs. If available, use skinless and boneless thighs, that will save you a LOT of work
- 2 Curry cubes, the soul of this dish

- Cooking oil, preferably olive oil, but that day I used grapeseed oil
- Enough water

------

1. De-bone the chicken thighs, which is not an easy task, and cut with the grain of the chicken. Watch how you hold the knife. My mom yelled at me across the phone to change my knife grip.
1. Cut the chicken thighs into pieces and set aside. Parallel to the direction of the bone, cut two slashes on each side.
1. Dice carrots, potatoes and onions.
3. Here comes the vegetables. Dice the carrot, the potato, the onion to pieces.
4. Boil the potatoes for a while to soften them, then sauté them with the carrots and onions in turn.
5. Add the chicken pieces to the pan with all the vegetables and sauté until the flesh turns white.
5. Add water to just submerge the ingredients. Boil over medium heat.
8. Once the water comes to a boil, add the curry and cook both pieces, stirring while simmering, until the chicken is tender. Stirring will prevent the curry and vegetables on the bottom from being overcooked. This is a long step, so some soothing but rhythmic music will help. I've attached my list of cooking songs at the end of the recipe, so stir to the music!
9. Serve it in a soup bowl or over rice. When I took the pot off the heat, my mom had to leave to go to work. She finished her breakfast and left her table, while I sat at my table to taste the first bite of my cooked dish. Our respective lives went on.
