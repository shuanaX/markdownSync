## Meaningful Place

My meaningful place is my greatgrandmother’s house. 
My greatgrandma had eight children, five daughters and three sons, and they all had children, so my family is large. Every lunar new year eve, the family gathered for dinner. That is a traditional Chinese house. In order to enter, you must step over a high threshold, which has been crossed by four generations of the family. There are blackandwhite photos of my greatgrandfather and his youngest son, who died young, on the wall directly in front of the main door. One of my aunts' naught carving marks can still be seen on the table under the wall. My greatgrandmother slipped the red envelopes into my pocket in front of the old Chinese canopy bed. The dim light illuminated by a few tungsten lamps, the camphor and mold oozing from damp corners, and the local dialect surrounded me for the duration of my stay.
In a way, I believe this old house represents the roots of this family, now a large one. Likewise, the historic district it sits in reveals the roots of the city, now a large one.
Over time, things changed. Fewer relatives met. The eldest son of my greatgrandparents settled in a neighboring city and never returned. Sisters of my grandma clashed for various reasons and could never really make up. Fluorescent lamps replaced the tungsten lamps. My greatgrandmother passed away. The dialect was never something I learned fluently.
By the time I left to study abroad, the house had been inherited by the only male member of my mother's generation. However, he was no better than his cousins.
Perhaps the place you came from only exists when you leave. I left in stride.

## Recipe + Playlist 

Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine in Canada during the pandemic. Chicken curry was a dish my mom would make for our family when I was home, and it was the dish that got me through the first week of quarantine when I entered Canada during the epidemic. The recipe below comes from the afternoon when I was shocked by the expensive takeout costs in Canada and made up my mind to cook my own food. I made a video call to my mom who was eating breakfast, separated by a 15hour time difference, to ask her how to make chicken curry. Her remote instructions are recorded below.

------

Ingredients:

- 1 purple onion,  preferably a large one
- 1 carrot, with the head leaves cut off
- 1-2 potato, peeled
- 6 chicken thighs. If available, use skinless and boneless thighs, that will save you a LOT of work
- 2 Curry cubes, the soul of this dish

- Cooking oil, preferably olive oil, but that day I used grapeseed oil
- Enough water

------

1. De-bone the chicken thighs, which is not an easy task, and cut with the grain of the chicken. Watch how you hold the knife. My mom yelled at me across the phone to change my knife grip.
1. Cut the chicken thighs into pieces and set aside. Parallel to the direction of the bone, cut two slashes on each side.
1. Dice carrots, potatoes and onions.
3. Here comes the vegetables. Dice the carrot, the potato, the onion to pieces.
4. Boil the potatoes for a while to soften them, then sauté them with the carrots and onions in turn.
5. Add the chicken pieces to the pan with all the vegetables and sauté until the flesh turns white.
5. Add water to just submerge the ingredients. Boil over medium heat.
8. Once the water comes to a boil, add the curry and cook both pieces, stirring while simmering, until the chicken is tender. Stirring will prevent the curry and vegetables on the bottom from being overcooked. This is a long step, so some soothing but rhythmic music will help. I've attached my list of cooking songs at the end of the recipe, so stir to the music!
9. Serve it in a soup bowl or over rice. When I took the pot off the heat, my mom had to leave to go to work. She finished her breakfast and left her table, while I sat at my table to taste the first bite of my cooked dish. Our respective lives went on.

Here is the promised playlist. Enjoy these catchy songs and delicious curries!

## Scholarly Writing Experiment #1: Reading the Faculty

Dear Dr. Sowlati,

As a fourth-year student in the Woodworking program at the University of British Columbia, I am writing to seek the opportunity to have you as my future graduate supervisor from September, 2024. I studied WOOD 339 under your guidance and am now studying WOOD 440 and W00D 492, which made me realize how mathematical methods and optimization theory can be integrated with the forest industry and supply chain management. Upon visiting the website of your research group, I learned more about your work and your emphasis on applications of modeling and data analysis in industry engineering. I was impressed by one of your papers investigated a robust optimization model for a forest-based biomass supply chain by introducing uncertain variables, namely biomass availability and time interval.

I used to study optimal control based on fractional-order differential equations to analyze the uncertain dynamics of complex systems and optimize the desired properties. Although I have studied different application areas, such as option pricing and circuit systems reliability (I would love to show you my paper on this if you are interested in), I have not been able to apply what I have learned from my major, wood science, to  optimization and uncertainty researches. However, your group's work has inspired me to look at the potential applications of mathematical models in forestry. The review part of your paper motioned above, written in an simple and concise way, is especially helpful for me to seek an entry point for my future researches. 

I find that few papers in this area build explicit stochastic mathematical models to deal with real-world uncertainty. Most of the time the Monte Carlo method is used, which is also the case in some papers of your group. Fractional order equations and stochastic processes are powerful tools for describing real-world uncertainty and solving optimization problems, and they may find their application in the forestry field.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate my interest and to discuss in detail with you at your convenience. After completing my undergraduate studies, I intend to pursue a master's degree in the hybrid field of optimal control and forest industry management.. Your guidance would be invaluable to me. Hopefully I will be able to participate in research with your group. 

I am looking forward to you reply. 

Sincerely, 
Hongxuan Xia

## Summary Practice

“The egg and the sperm: How science has constructed a romance based on stereotypical male/female roles”, written by Martin (1991), argues that the way biologists describe female and male genitals is based on gender stereotypes that values breading, even when academic terminology is used. In particular, it promotes a bias against female reproductive systems, where ovulation is hailed as a great accomplishment, whereas menstruation is considered to be a failure. Comparatively, descriptions of the male reproductive process are full of admiration and excitement.



## Summary and Response

In “*How sugar taxes punish people*”, Fessenden (2018) takes a clear-cut stand against imposing any tax on customers for products with sugar content. She argues that the overconsumption of sugar and the concomitant increase in the incidence of chronic diseases are the results of a questionable sugar production and distribution system that embodies a comprehensive set of problems, such as the overproduction of corn under anachronistic farm subsidies, the manipulation of government institutions by capital related to sugar industries, and the context of rising poverty. Instead of addressing the root cause of the problem, worldwide tax policies that impose an extra fee on sugar-buyers are placing an excessive burden on victims who are primarily poor people that affected by chronic sugar-related diseases. Furthermore, the revenues raised by the sugar tax are used for education and nutrition assistance, leaving the government with no real incentive to end sugar overconsumption. The author calls for changes in agricultural policies and subsidies to discourage the production of high-sugar products, thereby lowering the threshold for the consumption of healthy foods. In particular, Fessenden suggests a tax on producers and distributors, but the possibility of shifting the cost to consumers should also be considered.

Fessenden provides ample evidence that a sugar tax will not help solve the structural problems of the corn agriculture and food industries, but she seems on more dubious ground when she claims that “*let’s place a tax on those producing and distributing these products*” (Fessenden, 2018). In the grand scheme of things, an administrative measure to reduce sugar production and consumption may interfere with market freedom and individuals’ right of choice, which exposes the policy to a moral crisis; in the small scheme of things, a sugar reduction in practice is difficult to achieve, especially when fruits contain large amounts of natural sugar, and carbohydrates in grains are absorbed by human bodies in the form of sugar. By taxing only products containing synthetic sugar, including corn syrup, without regard to the intake of other forms of sugar, such a policy is more likely to be a disguised tax increase in the name of benefiting people's health. Acknowledging the threat that sugar poses to everyone’s health, last question I have is that both salt and fat are highly-associated with various cardiovascular diseases, so should we call for a way to penalize stakeholders of products with high salt or fat content for the health of all citizens?

## Scholarly Writing Experiment #3

This article reveals how racism against people of colour is hampering efforts to address climate change, exhausting coloured people into self-defending against unsafe residential communities and self-justifying their initiatives rather than making genuine contributions to save the planet. In response to this situation, the author urges that ecologically concerned people oppose racism and liberate the forces of visible minorities.

According to the article, despite the denials of security, justice and equality that coloured races suffer, "black people are significantly more concerned about climate change than white people (57 per cent vs 49 per cent)." Citing the above data, the author employs the rhetorical device of "logos" to support her argument that uniting the power of black people is essential to combat climate change. 
While the reader may find it persuasive, a deeper look reveals that the data is not as compelling as it should be. Claiming that compared to whites, people of colour have a better sense of morality, in this case, a greater concern about climate change, is a form of so-called benevolent racism, the ultimate objective of which is to reinforce stereotypes of racial difference and to rationalize the subordination of coloured races. However, this discourse is more disorienting, and even people of colour buy into it. Thus, it is difficult to say whether surveys that rely heavily on respondents' subjective attitudes reflect reality and are a reliable basis for disproving the irrationality of racism, or whether the results remain a projection of racist values that deepens prejudice against blacks.
